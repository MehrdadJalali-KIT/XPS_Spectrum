This Python script generates synthetic X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data using Gaussian peaks. It includes functionality to adjust specific frequencies with conditional random value additions, generate spectra data, plot synthetic spectra, and annotate peaks with labels.

## Features

- Generates synthetic XPS data using Gaussian peaks
- Adjusts specific frequencies with random value additions
- Plots synthetic spectra with annotated peaks
- Supports customization of the number of spectra and their parameters
- Inverts the x-axis of the plot for visualization purposes
